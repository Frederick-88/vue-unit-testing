### Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests

```
npm run test:unit
```

### Personal Notes :

- use `"console.log(wrapper.html())"` --- to see whole html of the component you chose

- If you are writing unit tests and want to test the functionality of a component individually, then setup the `"shallowMount"` function and test it.

If you want to test a nested component, then use the `"mount"` function.
